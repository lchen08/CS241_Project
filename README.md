# CS241_Project
The project was to used what we learned in Data Structures (specifically directed graphs) and base code to process city and road information. With this information, the minimum requirements were to display the information on the console, allow the user to add non-existing roads, remove existing roads, and find the shortest existing path between two cities.

The given files were city.dat and road.dat, which provided the city information and roads between the cities (with distances). The project came with a QueuePackage, StackPackage, and most of the GraphPackage. The files that were given but needed additional code to work were the Vertex and DirectedGraph classes. 

The Javadoc code will have my name (Lisa Chen) as the author if the code was created by me or has me as a coauthor. 

I coded the requirements and added an additional GUI (not required) using Java swing to allow easier and quicker city/road updating and action requests. The GUI also implements uploading the files (if there are multiple) and saving changes.
