# CS241_Project
The project was to used what we learned and base code to process city and road information. With this information, the minimum requirements were to display the information on the console, allow the user to add non-existing roads, remove existing roads, and find the shortest existing path between two cities.

I took that project and added a GUI using Java swing to allow easier and quicker city/road updating and action requests. The GUI also implements uploading the files (if there are multiple) and saving changes.
