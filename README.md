# CS241_Project
Completed in May 29, 2018, the project (also referred to as HW4) was to use what we learned in Data Structures (specifically directed graphs) and base code to process and display city and road information. With this information, the minimum requirements were to display all the city information on the console, allow the user to add non-existing roads, remove existing roads, and find the shortest existing path between two cities.

The prompt was added to the project as "proj3 prompt.pdf" as reference of the detailed requirements.

The given files were city.dat and road.dat, which provided the city information and roads between the cities (with distances). The project came with a QueuePackage, StackPackage, and most of the GraphPackage. The files that were given but needed additional code to work were the Vertex and DirectedGraph classes. 

The Javadoc code will have my name (Lisa Chen) as the author if the code was created by me or has me as a coauthor. 

I coded the requirements and added an additional GUI (not required) using Java swing to allow easier and quicker city/road updating and action requests. The GUI also implements uploading the files (if there are multiple) and saving changes (prompts for save and creates a file with a new name to ensure no overwriting original files).
